# [Assignment] #4 - Bootstrap Layout
Download the **assets** folder (found on Moodle) for the required screenshots, text content, and images. Also download the marking guide and instructions (found on Moodle). 

Work on this repo locally and push your files back up to the classroom repository as you work. Your instructor will see your work as you submit commits and can provide feedback if requested.

### Hint: On-Page Linking
In your menu you could have:

```html
<a href="#page-link">Page Link</a>
```

In the content of your web page you would have a corresponding section with the following code:

```html
<section id="page-link">
  <!-- section code -->
</section>
```

This will enable you to link to any area of your web page.

## Submission Requirements
Your assignment will be submitted via the GitHub repository and a zip file copy uploaded to Moodle. Push all completed files to the repo before the due date. You must have a minumum of **three (3)** commits to GitHub! Any commits submitted after the due date will be ignored.

>>LATE SUBMISSIONS WILL NOT BE GRADED.
